In this case here, the child nutrition reauthorization bill we had hoped to have already done by now is not completed. And if, in fact, this language was not put in here to extend expiring child nutrition authorization programs, and let me just kind of tell people what that is. It's things like school breakfasts and school lunches, and after school meals for kids, who otherwise wouldn't get access to meals in the children. Would a gentleman yield?

578984029.mp4," from North Carolina for the time, I have to rise today in strong opposition to this rule and unfortunately and reluctantly in opposition to the conference report itself. The main reason for this rule is simply outrageous. We've had a long debate for years around here about air dropping items in conference. That is the, what happens is that you have a bill that comes out of the house that does not have a provision in it, a bill that comes out of the Senate does not have a provision in it. Then in conference, policies and new laws are dropped in, in conference with no debate, no discussion, nothing passed off the floor of either body, but just come from afar, air dropped at conference time. Within this bill, there are at least five new programs that were air dropped in conference costing $150 million. That's in this bill. And it certainly is way beyond the scope of the Rules Committee to approve this. Maybe there's some debate in the Rules Committee sometime that they agreed to it, but certainly There's no other member that knows what these provisions are for, and again, to spend $150 million five new mandatory programs in this bill that no one has debated in either body is simply outrageous. And Mr. Speaker, I also today have to oppose the conference report reluctantly. And there are things in this conference report that I support, such as the research for agriculture, child nutrition aid to farmers, all of these things. However, this is not, in my opinion, a responsible bill. Today we're going to vote on an agricultural appropriation package that exceeds $121 billion. It contains huge increases in spending over last year's levels. Mandatory appropriations in this bill total $97.8 billion, that's $10 billion more than last year. and nearly two-thirds of this increase is for domestic nutrition programs, maybe very, very worthwhile and needed. That's a $6.2 billion increase, 9% over last year's level. However, neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee ever held a hearing on these items, or you're spending an additional $6.2 billion with a proper agency to actually discuss the need whether or not the spending is justified. Farm commodity programs receive a $2.8 billion increase that's 25% over last year. And again, Congress, the committee had no hearings to justify that kind of an increase. Federal crop insurance, which I very much support. Can I get a few more minutes? Two more minutes.",2
595062722.mp4," or the Com Act, is a bill this time has come and perhaps because the transition to digital has created the perk opportunity for industry to take care of this. But they did not take care of this for some 60 years. The bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue regulations based on industry standards for loud commercial advertisements within one year of enactment. The regulation would take effect one year after adopted by the FCC. Now according to testimony at a June energy and commerce hearing, consumer complaints about loud commercials have been streaming, streaming into the FCC as far back into 1960 and are among the most common complaints. Complaints continue to come into the FCC today. In fact, in the 25 quarterly reports on consumer complaints that have been released since 2002, 21 have listed complaints about the, quote, abrupt changes in volume during transition from regular programming to commercials, end quote. As among the top, the top consumer grievances regarding radio and television broadcasting. So as we can tell, this issue is a top issue for our consumers. Now this issue is a little bit more complex than it appears. Many different entities are responsible for producing and distributing the content that consumers hear and see in their living rooms. Each element may be recorded and provided at a different respective volume level. Moreover, shows and movies have a dynamic sound range to cover everything from a quiet scene to a huge explosion. Meanwhile, tend to have a narrow sound range. Volume levels are typically set for the programming, which can simply throw off the volume levels for the commercial. But that pointed out earlier. Now we have a solution in place because the transition to digital has made that possible. Two years ago, the Advanced Television Systems Committee established a subgroup on digital television loudness. Now, was this subgroup consisting of leading experts on audio technology who participated together in from all the major broadcasting networks, cable production companies, and post-production, manufacturing and education, all these very bright, talented, highly technical people got together in this subgroup? They established a way to solve the problem. And since it was established, these audio technology experts have crafted this hard-fought consensus on a recommended practice that should be employed across the TV industry to deal with the complaint that consumers have made for almost 50 years. I trust the collective wisdom of these technical experts, it's done by the private sector, and subgrouped hard work to craft a solution to the TV loudness issue. Let me say a few more comments about this. going to be some small cable companies, broadcasters, are going to have difficult time complying with this. Remember now, after one year, the FCC is going to take this directive that the advanced television system establish and it's going to make it industry wide. Now some of these small companies are going to complain that they can't afford to implement it. In the bill, there's a one-year extension for those small companies. If it turns out they still can't make it, there's another extension. So now we have the majority of the industry able to do this, but we have set aside within the bill a safety hardship in which they just demonstrate they can't do it for financial reasons, and they'll be left to have another year to meet the standards. So in a sense, Mr. Chairman, I think we have a solution to a problem that has been one the biggest complaints with the FCC all these years and so with that in mind I urge my colleagues to support HR 1804 and I reserve the balance of my time.

Would they suggest that there's something wrong with the fact that in contrast to what happened when they were running the show, we chose to put $14.8 billion for war costs that were previously funded in a supplemental, we chose to put them in the regular bill. So you didn't hide the cost in a regular bill. On infrastructure, as the gentleman pointed out, we've had collapsing infrastructure in this country. Would they suggest we remove the $10.8 billion in additional infrastructure funding? In health, we are about to pass the most momentous healthcare changes in the history of the country. We have $6.3 billion of additional funding over last year to expand the capacity of the healthcare system to deal with the fact that 31 million more people are going to be using that healthcare system. Would they suggest that we take that money out? When you total up the cost for those items that I've just recited, the rest of the increase in the bill is 4.8 billion dollars. That is equal to 1 percent increase. I make no apology for that because as the gentleman pointed out we are trying to deal with years of neglect of our domestic economy.

Judge Cook began his career in public service in 1951 when he was elected County Attorney for Logan County and Guthrie. He would hold several other positions in public service in Oklahoma including first assistant US attorney, chief trial attorney, and legal counsel and advisor to Governor Henry Belman. In the early 1970s, Judge Cook worked in Washington, D.C. for the Social Security Administration until beginning his career as a federal judge in 1974 when he was sworn in as U.S. District Judge and the Northern, Eastern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma. years later in 1979, Judge Cook became chief judge of the Northern District and served in that capacity for 13 years. In 1992, Judge Cook took senior status to enable the appointment of an additional judge to the Northern District. As a senior judge, he continued to be active and carried a full court docket for the next 12 years until a few months before his death in September 22, 2008. Judge Cook was adamantly committed to his belief that politics should play no role in the dispensing of justice and demonstrated that belief in his judicial rulings and the administration of his responsibilities as chief judge. He was a man of fairness and integrity who opened each court session with God bless the United States and saved this honorable court. Judge Cook's greatest legacy may be the restoration of the and the reopening of the original federal courthouse in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the federal courts removed another building about 45 years ago, the old federal building sat largely unused. Judge Cook saw this building as a solution when there became a need for additional court space. He spirited the effort to restore it to its original splendor. Judge Cook used his powers of persuasion and his influence as Chief Judge of the Northern district to insist on conforming the courthouse to its original design and decor. Without his involvement, the building would have never been used for its current purpose and the beauty of a lost era would not be visible as it is today in Tulso, Oklahoma. By his direct efforts, the building is now included in the national registry of historic places and is currently used for the courtrooms, judicial chambers, the bankruptcy court, and affiliated federal offices of the Northern District of Oklahoma. Due to the vision and hard work of Judge Cook, the building is now being used for its original purpose as a federal judicial courthouse. Preserving the beauty of a lost era as a federal judge, he conducted his duties in a nonpartisan manner. It is my hope that the naming of this federal building will be as equally bipartisan Equally as a bipartisan effort to his honor to the honor of this exceptional man And is an exemplary career in public service and bringing the federal courthouse back to its original grander I urge the adoption of HR 30305 and I yield back the balance of my time The gentleman yields back the gentleman from Florida reserves",1

Day after day, the submarineers entrusted their lives on unreliable torpedoes to protect them as they fought to protect the liberties and freedom of the United States. For their courage and valor that runs deep, the United States submarine force should be formally commended by the House of Representatives. House Resolution 773 resolves that the House of Representatives is committed to keeping alive their memory so that the American people never forget the courage and sacrifice. We will give honor to the 52 American submarines that were lost during World War II and the 3,500 mariners who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms of this great nation. The seven brave submarines who were awarded the Medal of Honor are John Cromwell, Samuel Deely, Eugene Fluxi, Howard Gilmore, Richard O'Kane, Lawson Rammage and George Street. Their courageous fighting spirit going above and beyond the call of duty is recognized and highly respected. Service members like them have set the example that our armed forces follows. The contributions of the United States Submarine Force were momentous and critical to winning World War II. They exemplify the legacy of commitment to guard our freedoms.

Sentinels of Freedom is an organization that provides support and opportunities selected veterans with injuries sustaining 60 percent or higher levels of disability in all branches of our military, post 9-11. They provide significant support in assisting our veterans to readjust back to civilian life and prosper in their hometowns or new communities. Each of the past recipients of the Sentinel of Freedom Scholarship has an inspiring story of recovery. Many of them have lived through injuries which they were not expected to survive and further endured many surgeries and months of recovery. For example, Army veteran Jake Brown accepted the first sentinel of Freedom Scholarship in 2004, crushed by a tank while serving in Germany, he was in a coma for 10 days and Jake was not expected to live, but now he is back in his hometown and he is thriving. Rick returned to his hometown of San Ramon, California with his wife, and currently works for UPS, where he is in two promotions. He is also on the Dean's list at Diablo Valley College. He has dreams of ultimately attending UC Berkeley's Hot School of Business. Despite having life-altering physical handicaps, veterans like Jake Brown are grateful to be alive and continue to prosper in their communities. As Mike Conklin, chairman of CEO and CEO of Sentinel of Freedom Describes, the program is not a charity, but rather an investment in the life of a person who has served our nation and has earned the right to achieve his or her part of the American dream. As our veterans return home from war, it's fitting to have House Resolution 461 before us today.

I think you've already covered all of most of my speech, but we are very honored to be able to name the outpatient clinic in Alexandria after a true American hero, Mr. Max Bilky, who grew up in a small farm near Alexandria, Minnesota. It was a 1950 graduate of Alexandria High School. He was drafted into the Army and sent to Korea in 1952. And shortly after he returned home from his tour of service in Korea, he re-enlisted and made the Army his full-time career. Max has been noted served in Korea, Germany, and lastly Vietnam, during his eighth month tour served as Operation Sergeant at Camp Alpha in Saigon. Where all soldiers were processed going to and coming from the United States. And as was noted, he was a last combat soldier to leave Vietnam while his family watched on television. After 21 years in the Army, Max retired in 1974 as master sergeant, eventually settled in Laurel, Maryland, where he lived with his wife, Lisa, and raised two daughters. After retiring from the Army, he earned a master's degree from Central Michigan University. As was noted, Max was very instrumental establishing the Criker system for our veterans and it was because of that he was at the Pentagon on September 11th and met his on timely death on that day. He was laid to rest as was noted on December 11th at Arlington. He had a distinguished career in the Army and as his civilian. He has the support of all Minnesotans and of our veterans organizations and he very much deserves to have this clinic named after him. I want to commend the VA for opening this clinic. I think this is the fifth clinic that they have opened in my district. It was proposed in 2004 and we had the grand opening ceremony just last month and for too long rural veterans in my district have had to travel too far for healthcare, but this clinic will bring veterans healthcare services closer to all the veterans who live in that area. The VA estimates that it will serve 3,500 local veterans with primary care and mental health care and will provide a variety of other services as well. So I thank you Mr. Beaker and I urge your house to pass this legislation, yield back the balance of my time.

You've got community banks who have to have complete transparency. They've got the federal regulators that come in and check every dot and title. They have to make sure that everything is just the way the federal regulators want it. Some of us have been concerned that that over aggressiveness by federal regulators and the most stable of our institution, financial institutions, the community banks has helped dry up a great deal of the credit. So imagine the hypocrisy to have federal regulators just swarm in like locusts to community banks who are the most stable and have been the most careful in federal banking and they're being regulated by people who will not open their books to this congress. That in itself is such an outrage that it alone ought to be a basis for getting Ron Paul's bill here to the floor, getting it passed. Let's open them up. And I love what Newt Gingrich said.

It's to greatly increase the likelihood that they will not get the money. That is not in the interest of the administration.

I rise to the support of this resolution, which expresses our condolences and sympathy for the people of Italy following the terrible loss of life, which occurred in the central abruzal region last April, which was struck by a powerful earthquake. Tragically the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck in the early morning of April 6 killed over 250 people. of thousands more were left homeless as their family properties were destroyed. Over 15,000 buildings, rich in culture and history were obliterated in just moments by the powerful shocks. I note that despite the danger from the strong aftershocks after the earthquake, heroic Italian rescue workers nevertheless entered the unstable buildings at risk to themselves and pulled over hundreds of survivors to safety. Mr. Speaker, when we think of Italy, our first thoughts are of the beauty, the history, the culture, and especially the warmth and kindness of its people. As a nation, America also has a tremendous affinity for Italy, since our country has been greatly enriched by those Italian immigrants who came to our shores, became a part of our American nation and contributed so much to our culture and economic prosperity. And so, in the wake of that immense disaster, Americans mourned in sympathy with the people of Italy over their tremendous loss and committed to stand with them as they work to rebuild and recover. I'm pleased to support this resolution, which expresses our deepest condolences to the Italian people, and notes that, with the support of American citizens, humanitarian organizations are continuing to provide assistance in the rebuilding of those cities that were affected by the earthquake.

595179947.mp4," second amendment to HR 1385. I have always supported granting the 6 Virginia tribes federal recognition and I am extremely happy that this bill has included language that seeks to prevent casino-style gaming in the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, I was troubled to learn of a change that was made to the bill without notification to any of the local communities that would be affected. In the section dealing with the monican Indian tribe, the area that the tribe could have placed in trust for their reservation grew from one county to Originally, it was an area of approximately 479 square miles, and now it's an area of approximately 3,728 square miles. What is even more disturbing to me is that none of these new localities knew that they would be part of an area in which the tribes could acquire lands. My office only discovered it once the bill was scheduled for floor consideration. This bill could dramatically affect these counties. If tribal lands were established in these counties, it could mean the localities would lose all control of the lands that were placed in trust in them. We would no longer be in control of zoning, environmental reviews, and these localities could no longer collect tax revenues from these lands. These are serious concerns and could greatly impact operations of the counties. The fact that the bill would establish tribal land in these counties is a total surprise to these jurisdictions. They have not had a sufficient opportunity to discuss and study how such a change would affect them. The addition of these new counties is also a total surprise to me and the counties involved they should be removed from this bill. I've also spoken to my colleagues Tom Perry-Ello and Rick Boucher of the fifth and ninth congressional districts who also represent these newly added counties and they also support this amendment. These counties, these communities should have the right to know how these changes will affect them as far as this legislation is concerned and the far-reaching consequences that could permanently change central Virginia.

However, a number of these companies have invested a lot of money in the technology to allow consumers to be able to pay their credit cards in different ways, And thereby avoid a late fee, many concerns that many of us have was that if we somehow regulated and denied the ability completely of credit card companies to be able to pay to charge a fee for this service that they would discontinue it, and we felt like that might even cost consumers more money because they would be charged late fees and interest. I also appreciate the gentleman as I think all of us believe that disclosure is an important part of making credit card use a better tool for consumers.

595217088.mp4," of C-SPAN. I was watching what was going on. I was only elected in December. And I come from North Louisiana where people respect the institutions. And we're talking about two very big and very important institutions, AIG, which we know is too big to fail. That's the reason why we've been bailing AIG out. And then, of course, our presidency and Congress itself. I guess the rhetorical question I have after this embarrassment, which is, first of all, how did this screw up happen and where is that person or persons who is willing to own up to the mistake that was made here? But going back to the beginning, we remember that in the first tarp issue, money was, of course dealt out very quickly almost overnight as a result of the need or perceived need for bailout. And we found that money was going to spaz in California and feson hunting in the UK. And that should have at least given some warning that this kind of abuse would have happened. Then we fast forward, we released the money again, no strings attached, and we find out that some kind of deal with struck only with Democrats in the room that first put in and of course then took out in conference we think, there's very important clause that would have avoided bonuses going, very rich bonuses over a million dollars in some cases to people who were part of the problem. But it really comes down to this, is it in competency or is it dishonesty? I think that's the second question that we have to answer beyond who was involved in this. Certainly we have the Secretary of Treasurer who was approved under dubious conditions to begin with, having somehow forgotten or perhaps incompetently not paid his taxes, and then he was up to his hips in this whole situation with the bailout, But somehow, didn't realize that this clause would be put in and then somehow jerked out. And even the administration has more or less offered him up as a scapegoat by saying that they really didn't know really what was going on and that was really happened on his watch. I certainly think first and foremost that Mr. Geithner should resign. I think he's done enough damage as it is. Also, today was a disgrace in the house here where after having rammed down our throats, a stimulus bill in which no Republican supported, which did not contain the protective measure that should have been in to avoid these disgraceful bonuses, it was released only hours before But being, of course, over 1,000 pages, it was impossible for anyone on this side of the aisle to have any idea what was in that bill, much less some small clauses this. After all of that, hopefully to gain that money back and perhaps some honor to this house, the Republican freshman advanced a bill that would have put such strings attached to the 30 billion left in the bill out that would make it impossible for them to receive it without paying this back 100%. But instead that bill never made it to the floor and we had upon suspension another bill that was honestly a horrible bill, although it was the best bill we have to date, which only took back through taxes 90% of the money that was paid out in bonuses. And of course the question is, is this even constitutional? Is it constitutional to pass a bill that's pointed at a very small segment of the society to punish them and to do it on a retroactive basis? I'm not a lawyer, I don't know, but it'll be very interesting to see what comes to light. I would also like to know what part our speaker had in this. It just seems like that once light is thrown into a situation like this, all the leadership who is behind it blow out like a cubby Aquil. So I ask today that perhaps we have investigations, perhaps we have, we find the folks who are really behind this, but in any event we need to avoid this from happening again. So in closing I would say Mr. Speaker that the question is in competency or dishonesty. I certainly hope it's not the latter and if it is in competency I think we need to renew some leadership positions and get us back to a competent pathway and with that I yield back.

It's a non-steameless bill, it's not going to stimulate the economy, it's going to create very few jobs if any at all. You've given us a fair dollar of tax relief, y'all are going to spend $4 to put new grass on the Washington Mall. It's insane. It's absolutely insane, the things that are in this bill. I'm going to vote no and I encourage my colleagues to vote no and I encourage American people to stand up and say we're not going to tolerate this kind of stuff going on in this country. We've got to slow down. We've got to look at alternatives that really will stimulate the economy. That's my review of taxes and leaving dollars in the hands of the Gentlemen, signers, expires.",2
595255635.mp4," Congress, and yes, it's a new day, but what we're debating isn't that new. It's in fact a recycled campaign promise to a favored special interest and a sad reminder of the path this majority continues to take this country. As most folks already know, equal pay for equal work is the law of the land, and it has been since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. businesses do a tremendous job, paying employees fairly regardless of gender. But the bill before the House today treats wage discrimination as if it were systematic. And in the midst of economic challenges, we're failing to address the real challenges affecting Americans, wages, and the purchasing power of their paychecks. If this measure becomes law, power will be turned over to bureaucrats and trial lawyers to interject, distort, and oversee how wages are determined through lawsuits and through regulations. It means less incentive, Mr. Speaker, less incentive, for employers to offer a variety of working situations like flex time or more limited travel, because doing so may put an employer at risk of being sued, hardly a wise action on their part. In turn, current and prospective workers will suffer through lower wages, slower job creation, or simply fewer opportunities to make, to meet individual worker needs. All of this leads, Mr. Speaker, to this motion to recommit. One of the distinctive changes being made today to the Equal Pay Act is the inclusion of unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in a lawsuit. As members already know, compensatory damages redress wrongful conduct and punitive damages are to deter future wrongful conduct. But under the Equal Pay Act, an employee does not need to show discriminatory intent in order to prevail. As some have correctly described this bill, it's a boondoggle for trial lawyers. They'll be able to collect unlimited damages, even, Mr. Speaker, even when a disparity is not intended. This serves no legitimate purpose and turns the equal pay act into a lottery. That's why this motion is a simple, common sense change that caps reasonable, reasonable attorneys fees at $2,000 per hour. Now, surely we can agree on that. By limiting attorney's fees, it is the intent that lawyers would take cases based on actual discrimination and merit and prevent lawsuit abuse. Today's litigation system unfortunately does little to restrain the filing of lawsuits. It's why lawsuits can result in millions of dollars in lawyers fee yet plaintiffs get pennies on the dollar. It's why tort costs consume approximately 2 percent of our gross domestic product, billions of dollars. It's why 10 percent of every health dollar on every dollar spent on health care is attributed to the cost of liability and defensive medicine, hundreds of billions of dollars. This cap on attorney's fees will ensure that victims of discrimination are protected with appropriate incentives. Without a cap, this bill will have a detrimental effect on labor markets. Increasing lawsuits and unlimited damages will discourage hiring and may further segregate employment preferences for one gender in favor of another. On this side of the aisle, Republicans understand that fair-minded business folks want to make honest living without, favoring political friends or bureaucrats, impeding job creation or dictating how a business should be run. Let's adopt this motion to recommit. It's a new Congress and a new day, but let's not make our first act an old recycled campaign promise to political friends. I urge adoption of the motion to recommit and yield back the balance. Gentlemen, eels back to the balance of this time.",2
595256290.mp4," overall idea. It's a good bill in general. There needs to be more clarity. Many of us have wondered who is building these presidential libraries and this will help inform the public just who it is that's doing that. Concern I have is that there is provision in the bill for filing errors or omissions that could send somebody to prison for five years. Now As a former judge, I've presided over thousands and thousands of felony cases. I've sent, I don't know how many people to prison. That's not a concern. My reputation was, as one criminal was over her telling another, he'll give you a fair trial, but if you're guilty, you don't want his court. I don't have a problem sending people to prison. But one thing, probably the best conservative organization as far as getting out message, the Heritage Foundation, and the ACLU have actually been in agreement on this body, almost on whims, throws in a prison sentence as an added provision. And we are having people go to prison who shouldn't. If it is a dollar issue, then find a million, 10 million, whatever would be appropriate, but we should not in this body continually subject people to have being taken down in their home handcuffed when they made an error that should not be criminalized. So that is the concern I have. This never went through judiciary. It has been through prior congresses. Never went through judiciary. The crime subcommittee to look at that specific aspect. That is a concern. And it is something that we should not be doing over criminalizing provisions by just sticking that in as an exclamation point. It needs to be well thought through before we provide a way to send somebody to prison. So I appreciate the time and I hope that could be taken out because that is an aspect inappropriate.
